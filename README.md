# ArcGIS-GTIFF-Exporter
Do you have a raster dataset in ArcGIS Pro? Do YOU want to export it in multiple pieces? Do YOU want to go faster than exporting each piece one at a time? if yes to all of those, this is the repository for you.

This is a simple Python notebook to run in ArcGIS Pro. It allows you to batch export all rasters in a geodatabase as individual GeoTIFF images. You don't need it until you need it.
